# Cybersecurity Fundamentals & Hands-on Exploration via TryHackMe's Cybersecurity 101 Path

### *A Self-Learning Article on Cyber Crime Investigation & Digital Forensics*

---

## 🧩 Introduction

In today’s digital era, the rapid evolution of technology has brought unprecedented convenience — but it has also fueled the rise of **cybercrime**. From data breaches and phishing scams to ransomware and identity theft, cyber threats have become more sophisticated than ever. As a result, **Cyber Crime Investigation** and **Digital Forensics** have emerged as essential disciplines for ensuring justice and protecting digital assets.

To deepen my understanding of these areas, I enrolled in the **TryHackMe Cybersecurity 101 Path**, a structured and interactive self-learning platform that offers real-world, hands-on experience in cybersecurity. This path introduced me to fundamental concepts, tools, and practical scenarios that mimic real-world incidents, aligning closely with the investigative mindset required in cyber forensics.

## 🔍 Understanding Cyber Crime Investigation

Cyber Crime Investigation involves the process of **identifying, analyzing, and prosecuting cybercriminals** by collecting digital evidence from computers, networks, and online environments.  
It follows a systematic procedure similar to physical crime investigations but focuses on the **digital footprint** left by attackers.

### Key Stages of Cyber Crime Investigation

1. **Detection and Identification:** Recognizing that an incident has occurred, such as a breach, unauthorized access, or malware infection.  
2. **Preservation of Evidence:** Ensuring that data integrity is maintained by creating bit-by-bit copies and securing original evidence.  
3. **Collection and Analysis:** Using forensic tools to extract data, identify malicious artifacts, and reconstruct the sequence of events.  
4. **Attribution:** Determining the origin or identity of the attacker using techniques like IP tracing and behavioral analysis.  
5. **Reporting and Presentation:** Compiling evidence into legally admissible reports for use in court proceedings.

## 🧮 Digital Forensics and Its Importance

**Digital Forensics** complements cyber investigations by providing a **methodical approach to data recovery and analysis**. It focuses on:
- Examining compromised devices (computers, mobiles, IoT devices)
- Extracting hidden or deleted data
- Reconstructing incident timelines
- Supporting law enforcement and judicial processes

In modern digital forensics, specialists rely on tools like **Autopsy**, **FTK**, **EnCase**, and **Volatility** for data analysis and memory forensics. These tools help trace cybercriminal activities and validate the authenticity of digital evidence.

## 🧑‍💻 Insights from TryHackMe’s Cybersecurity 101 Path

The **Cybersecurity 101 Path** on TryHackMe provides an excellent foundation for learners to explore cybersecurity through interactive labs and guided exercises. Below are the core areas I learned and practiced during the journey:

### 1. Introduction to Cybersecurity
The path begins with the basics — understanding the **CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**, threat types, and attack surfaces. It explains how every digital system, from personal devices to cloud infrastructure, can be targeted.

### 2. Networking Fundamentals
Networking is the backbone of cybersecurity. The course explored IP addressing, subnets, DNS, and HTTP protocols — crucial for tracking cyber attacks and understanding how attackers exploit network vulnerabilities.

### 3. Linux and Command-Line Skills
Many cyber investigations require proficiency in Linux. TryHackMe’s labs guided me through using terminal commands, process monitoring, and file permissions — essential for forensic data extraction and log analysis.

### 4. Practical Security Tools
Hands-on exposure to tools such as **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, and **Burp Suite** provided real-world experience in scanning, packet capture, and traffic inspection. These are the same tools forensic experts use to analyze suspicious behavior.

### 5. Introduction to Threat Intelligence
The final modules focused on identifying attack patterns and understanding adversary tactics — an important step in predicting and preventing future incidents.

## 🧠 Applying Learning to Cyber Forensics

After completing the TryHackMe path, I could relate each learning module to the real-world cyber investigation process:

| Cybersecurity Concept | Forensics Application |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Network Scanning (Nmap) | Identifying compromised hosts in a network |
| Packet Analysis (Wireshark) | Extracting communication patterns from captured traffic |
| Log Analysis | Reconstructing the attacker’s actions |
| Linux Forensics | Retrieving deleted or hidden files |
| Threat Intelligence | Mapping attacker behavior and linking to known groups |

This practical exposure strengthened my understanding of **how theoretical cybersecurity principles translate into actionable forensic methods**.
